"<t size='1.4' color='#2394ef' underline='true'>Introduction</t><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<t><t color='#ffec1c'>CTI</t> (<t color='#ffec1c'>Conquer The Island</t>) is a gamemode where two sides, West and East fight for the control of an island.</t><br />
<br />
Each side are led by a <t color='#e8bd12'>Commander</t> which may construct a base thanks to the <t color='#e8bd12'>MHQ</t>.<br />
<br />
As soon as the base is available, you may decide to reinforce your team by purchasing additional units and vehicles.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the <t color='#e8bd12'>Commander</t> may assign assign different tasks to your team.<br />
<br />
According to mission parameters there are several conditions under which game can be won: standardparameter is 'towns', <br />
which means you have to capture a certain number (in Takistan and Chernarus defauld=12 | In Zargabad defauld=7) of towns to win the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
For optional victory-conditions, check parameters <br />
(e.g: 'annihilation'=all enemy forces and structures have to be destroyed).<br />
<br />

//----------------------------------------RESPAWN
"<t size='1.4' color='#2394ef' underline='true'>Respawn</t><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<t size='1.2' color='#ffec1c' align='left'>Respawn-Penalty</t><br />
<br />
Getting killed too often in a short period of time will increase your respawn-timer (displayed in the minimap-area) by 10 seconds per respawn. <br />
This penalty will disappear after a while without dying.<br />
<br />
<br />
<t size='1.2' color='#ffec1c' align='left'>Respawnpoints:</t><br />
<br />
<br />
Generally respawnpoints are displayed as yellow circles on the map, which you see during your respawntime.<br />
<br />
These locations can be chosen by clicking on the circle. There are certain objects which establish spawn-locations:<br />
<br />
Mash (the tent, medics can deploy as special-skill).<br />
<br />
MEVs (an ambulance-vehicle is included in the set of vehicles you have from beginning or several vehicles can be purchased for purpose of spawning in light factory, heavy factory or air factory).<br />
<br />
Towncenters of captured towns: it is also possible to spawn at towncenters, which belong to your side. These spawnpoints are also limited in range (600m), according to the circle around the town. This option can be useful for defenders of a town.<br />
<br />
Mash and MEV-spawns are limited in range (600m), where they provide 'spawnability', that means if you die more than 600m away from these objects, you have to spawn at an unlimited spawnpoint.<br />
<br />
Spawnpoints of unlimited range are any buildings of base, except servicepoint and anti-airradar.<br />
<br />
Spawnbuldings: <br />
MHQ, Field-Hospital [FH], Baracks [B],Light-Factory [LF] Heavy-Factory [HF], Air-Factory [AF]).<br />
You can spawn there, no matter where you die on map.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<t size='1.4' color='#2394ef' underline='true'>So:</t><br /><br />
be careful when you die and where you die. Always be aware of your spawn-locations. <br />
It might save time, if you wait with the attack on a town untill spawn is established. <br />
An existing spawnpoint prevents players from having to travel all the way from base to town over and over again.<br />

",
//--------------------------------------------------Towns
"<t size='1.4' color='#2394ef' underline='true'>Towns</t><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As mentioned above it is goal of the game to capture a number of towns. Each of these towns is represented by a big circle (600m radius) on the map.<br />
<br />
There are several states a town can have, indicated by colour markings. Towns which can be captured have an orange marking in a 400m-radius around the center. These towns are adjacent to the territory already occupied by one side. Towns without coloured markings are not capturable because they are not linked with the already occupied area. <br />
<br />
Towns with a hatched yellow marking in a 600m radius are also not capturable, because enemy captured it recently and it is in so called 'peace-time' (details see below). When you start an attack on a town (with orange 400m-radius), notice that the defending units first spawn, when a friendly unit crosses the 600m-radius. So pay attention when crossing the line.<br />
<br />
<br />
The relevant buildings of a town are the depot (town-center) in the center of the circle, surrounded by a 50m-radius of slightly darker colour marking. Moreover a town can have one or more strongpoints (SPs, small cylinders on map).<br />
<br />
You have to capture these SPs (notice counter 'strongpoint'), before you advance to the towncenter and finally capture the town by creating numerical superiority within the 50m radius of towncenter (notice counter 'town').<br />
<br />
Once a town is captured it will switch its colour marking to hatched green 600m-radius. Next to towncenter, a supplyvalue (SV) is displayed, e.g. 10/70. This SV can be increased by sending supplytrucks between MHQ or servicepoint (for reload) and the 50m-radius of towncenter. <br />
<br />
A fully 'pushed' town (e.g. 70/70) creates a higher income of supplies and money for the <br />
commander and if town is attacked, there will spawn more and better units to defend it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Most of explanations refer to default parameters. If params are changed, some explanations are no longer valid. <br />
<br />
",
//---------------------------------Peacetime
"<t size='1.4' color='#2394ef' underline='true'>Peacetime</t><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Generally there are two kinds of peacetime: <br />
a peacetime for towns recently captured by enemy, which is marked with hatched yellow 600mradius and a 'friendly' one, which is displayed with a hatched green 600m-radius marking.<br />
<br />
These friendly peacetime-zones are prohibited for enemy to enter in the specified number of seconds (notice counter, displayed on map). <br />
<br />
If a friendly unit (player or ai) enters a town in enemy peacetime (or vice versa), the counter will increase, which means that the town will stay uncapturable for even longer. <br />
<br />
So, don't enter peacetime without a good reason, it may harm your <br />
side to an extend that you cannot capture an important town for the next hours!!!<br />
