["Mission Rules", 
"
<br/> 
No upgrade tree ( all upgrade set to max )<br/>
Instead of basing the strategy with arcade style upgrades, Ive tweaked the mission to base on territorial conquest and economy.<br/><br/>
[] Mission Economy and  vehicle price tweaked and increased<br/>
Economy and Territory are the CORE of this mission, vehicle prices are well balanced, after a lot of attempt Red and Blue are now well balanced.<br/>
During the mission progress you will be able to use more advanced and expensive vehicles, Play as team and get the town capture reward!<br/><br/>
[] Airport Hangars ( Planes can only be buyed there )<br/>
Airplanes are not 4x4 jeep so you will need a runway to takeoff<br/><br/>
[] no camps for unlimited rearm and respawn:<br/>
Medic can deploy mobile respawn tent (multiple without autodelete) so respawn will be dinamyc and  destructable this increase teamplay and global gameplay compared to static camp, that often are campered and allow to rearm in real unreal way... game offer more real, work around to have AT-ammo without just run with a vehicle close to a camp capture to have unlimited weapons/ammo and respawn. you have to play closed with other player ( medic and other classes ) and use support vehicles, backpack and all features that can help your side to advance in this hostile territory.<br/><br/>
[] restricted gear<br/>Is not possible to equip heavy sniper rifle / mg with AT weapons, as in real life you cant carry so much<br/>
Medic will have less gear space due to medikit.<br/><br/>
[] Territorial conquest<br/>
To capture towns you need a territorial link here its really  important to play with a good team strategy<br/>
On mission startup the closest town to MHQ can be captured, then you need a road clear link to other town<br/>
you will see capturable town in the map with an orange circle marker, plan your advance in territory and try to move your frontline as deep as you can.."]];

<br/>
Main goal of this mission is to allow good team to pratice different strategies and massive team play, in order to give a big advantage to well organized team, lot of Arcade feature of standard Warfare are removed. Playing this mission cooperating with  friends and with good strategy will be really rewarding. Also if the map is big with the tweaked  mission rules  you will fight really intense pvp battle! <br/><br/>
Please note: All default Mission parameters are studied according to the mission goal read them to know all mission settings."]];
